# Personal Website Repository

Welcome to the repository for [mike-budnick.com!](https://www.mike-budnick.com/) - a personal website showcasing a sophisticated infrastructure built with industry-standard Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) technologies. This website may appear unassuming on the surface, with its use of native CSS and static HTML for the front-end, but it conceals a powerful architecture beneath.

## Project Summary

This website serves as a concise showcase of the owner's expertise and commitment to excellence. It demonstrates their ability to create world-class applications that excel in quality, performance, and security. Here are some key highlights of the project:

- **Sophisticated CI/CD Pipeline**: The website is built and deployed using a robust CI/CD pipeline. It leverages GitHub Workflows to run unit and end-to-end (E2E) Cypress testing against a pre-production "staging" environment before deploying to the "prod" environment.

- **Infrastructure as Code**: The project's infrastructure is provisioned using the TypeScript AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) library. This approach allows for the efficient management of AWS resources and services.

- **Securely Served**: The website is served securely with TLS/HTTPS through AWS Route 53, ensuring data integrity and user security.

- **Efficient Content Delivery**: Content is efficiently delivered to users through a CloudFront Distribution, enhancing the website's performance and responsiveness.
