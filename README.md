# Personal Website Repository

Welcome to the repository for [mike-budnick.com!](https://www.mike-budnick.com/) â€“ a personal website showcasing my expertise as a Full Stack and Product Developer, with a strong foundation in DevOps and cloud infrastructure. While the site leverages industry-standard CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code, it is equally a demonstration of my ability to deliver user-facing features, scalable APIs, and robust end-to-end solutions.

## Project Summary

This website is a concise showcase of my skills across the full stack: from building engaging user interfaces and APIs to automating deployments and managing cloud resources. It demonstrates my commitment to delivering high-quality, performant, and secure products. Here are some key highlights of the project:

- **Full Stack & Product Development**: The site is designed and developed end-to-end, including front-end (HTML, CSS, JS), back-end integrations, and user experience considerations.

- **Sophisticated CI/CD Pipeline**: Built and deployed using a robust CI/CD pipeline. GitHub Workflows run unit and end-to-end (E2E) Cypress testing against a pre-production "staging" environment before deploying to "prod".

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is provisioned using the TypeScript AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) library, enabling efficient management of AWS resources and services.

- **Securely Served**: The website is served securely with TLS/HTTPS through AWS Route 53, ensuring data integrity and user security.

- **Efficient Content Delivery**: Content is efficiently delivered to users through a CloudFront Distribution, enhancing the website's performance and responsiveness.
