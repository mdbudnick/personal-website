      <p class="project-summary">This straightforward website, while presenting an unassuming exterior with its
        use of native CSS and static HTML for the front-end, conceals a sophisticated infrastructure that exemplifies
        industry-standard Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) technologies. Beneath the surface, it
        includes both unit and end-to-end (E2E) Cypress testing, which are run against a pre-production "staging"
        environment
        before "prod" deployment through the seamless orchestration of GitHub Workflows. The infrastructure for this
        website is provisioned using the Typescript AWS CDK library, and it is served securely with TLS/HTTPS through
        Route53, and efficiently through a CloudFront Distribution. This website serves as a concise showcase of my
        expertise, highlighting the depth of my skills and knowledge and commitment to excellence. It is a testament to
        my
        capacity to create world-class applications in quality, performance, and security ready to meet and exceed your
        needs.</p>

    <p class="project-summary">Breathbox is a simple and elegantly designed JavaScript website that is
      thoughtfully engineered to facilitate the practice of the breath box technique with ease. The
      breath box technique, for the uninitiated, is a mindfulness practice that involves structured and rhythmic
      breathing patterns to promote relaxation and stress reduction. Built with Typescript modules and
      compiled using the industry-standard Browserify, the website is deployed effortlessly with Terraform and hosted
      on Microsoft Azure, ensuring the utmost reliability and scalability for end-users. Breathbox is just a small
      example of my commitment to robust development practices. I invite you to make Breathbox a companion on your
      journey towards enhanced well-being and mindfulness!</p>
