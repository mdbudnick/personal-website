      <p class="project-summary">Breathbox is a simple and elegantly designed JavaScript website that is
        thoughtfully engineered to facilitate the practice of the breath box technique with ease. The
        breath box technique, for the uninitiated, is a mindfulness practice that involves structured and rhythmic
        breathing patterns to promote relaxation and stress reduction. Built with Typescript modules and
        compiled using the industry-standard WebPack, the website is deployed effortlessly with Terraform and hosted
        on Microsoft Azure, ensuring the utmost reliability and scalability for end-users. Breathbox is just a small
        example of my commitment to robust development practices. I invite you to make Breathbox a companion on your
        journey towards enhanced well-being and mindfulness!</p>

      <p class="project-summary">This straightforward website, while presenting an unassuming exterior with its use of
        native CSS and static HTML for the front-end, conceals a sophisticated infrastructure that exemplifies
        industry-standard Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) technologies. Beneath the surface, it
        includes both unit and end-to-end Cypress testing, which are run against a pre-production "staging"
        environment before deployment to "prod", where they are run again and will trigger a rollback to a stable
        version if they fail in prod for whatever reason. This is all seamlessly orchestrated with a GitHub Workflow <a
          href="https://github.com/mdbudnick/personal-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/prod_test_and_sync.yml"
          )>(source)</a>
        whenever user-facing changes are pushed to the main branch. The infrastructure for this website is provisioned
        using the Typescript AWS CDK library and served securely with TLS/HTTPS through Route53. All content is
        delivered and cached efficiently via CloudFront Distribution.
