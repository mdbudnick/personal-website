        <p class="project-summary">
          PiHole Kubernetes Ansible Configuration is an automation project designed to simplify
          the deployment and management of PiHole servers on a Kubernetes cluster. Leveraging Ansible, this playbook
          configures individual PiHole instances on hosts belonging to the 'piholes' group within the inventory. The
          servers, based on the docker-pi-hole image, are deployed on Kubernetes and exposed on port 53 using NodePort.
          This setup allows for efficient DNS filtering, and the Ansible playbook provides flexibility through easily
          configurable variables. Ideal for local network DNS management, this project ensures a straightforward and
          reproducible deployment of PiHole with minimal user intervention.</p>

        <p class="project-summary">I've wanted to make a home Kubernetes cluster for a long time, with enough power to
          be meaningful and efficiently based on my personal needs. After naming your hosts correctly, and configuring
          Ansible on the network machine you will be running it from, one will upgrade the target hosts, apply a best
          practices security posture, and install a high-availabilty multi-architecture Kubernetes cluster with a single
          command! While straightforward in concept, this project has been a magnificent experience in learning about
          network and system administration, automation with Ansible and Kubespray, bash scripting, Keepalived, cable
          management, BIOS menus, networking, boot loading and more. Now I have my own home cluster, and can replicate
          it at will. I even got to make some custom 3D printed components, check it out!

        <p class="project-summary">This straightforward website, while presenting an unassuming exterior with its use of
          native CSS and static HTML for the front-end, conceals a sophisticated infrastructure that exemplifies
          industry-standard Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) technologies. Beneath the surface, it
          includes both unit and scheduled end-to-end Cypress testing, which are run against a pre-production "staging"
          environment before deployment to "prod", where they are run again and will trigger a rollback to a stable
          version if they fail in prod for whatever reason. This is all seamlessly orchestrated with a GitHub Workflow

            )>(source)</a>
          whenever user-facing changes are pushed to the main branch. The infrastructure for this website is provisioned
          using the Typescript AWS CDK library and served securely with TLS/HTTPS through Route53. All content is
          delivered and cached efficiently via CloudFront Distribution.

        <p class="project-summary">Khipu game is a Phaser creation that I worked on in collaboration with the Kuychi Project.
          The project was founded to spread bilingualism and cultural exchange between the Spanish and Quechua speaking populations in Peru.
          This game is a simple platformer with enemies that is an introduction to the Quechua language, teaching the numbers 1 - 10.
          I was brought in to help modernize the game to the latest version and Phaser, in the hopes of creating a mobile app of the game.
          That would require a responsive version of the game, which is currently being researched and scoped.

        <p class="project-summary"> This is a simple minimalistic revisit of the breathbox animation! I wanted to make something
          in CSS native, so I came up with this design, which uses webkit-animation and keyframes to step through changes to
          width, height, top, left and border-radius, with a border: 2px solid white; in the middle of the AI-generated image.
          It looks really great, and with the addition of a slider and a smattering of JQuery, we have a really powerful, but
          minimalistic tool for practising mindfulness and healthy breathig techniques! Give it a try!
